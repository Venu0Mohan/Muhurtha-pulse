# 🕉️ Muhurtha Pulse

*Muhurtha Pulse* is a spiritually attuned Vedic timing engine for seekers wishing to align their daily sankalpa with cosmic rhythms. It generates sacred muhurthas, overlays Dasha progressions, tracks Panchanga elements, and highlights inauspicious periods—all from a place of devotion, not profit.

This project is offered open-source as seva—built by a devotee, not for fame or gain, but to help fellow beings navigate time as a sacred flow.
